(1) Configuration
	Ubuntu 14.04, Anaconda2-4.4.1, python2.7, caffe-master
(2) Data pre-processing
	Colorchecker dataset link,  http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/data/shi_gehler/
	Extract the png images into data/colorchecker-origin, no subfolders.
	16bit to 8bit, run image_8bit.m
	bright and dark piexel and sample: python search_patch_neighbor.py， 
	gamma correction patch, run gamma.m
	run create_data_lmdb.sh and create_lmdb.py to get LMDB file
(3) Model Training
	For context network: in data/context_network/ python patch_model.py 
	For refinement network: in data/ refinement_network/ python patch_model.py
(4) About pretrained model and LMDB file
	To get the pretrained models on the ColorChecker dataset, please download Pretrained models on the ColorChecker Dataset link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NfvBGdxmj3oA503UJK9pbg 
key：qlxv, and put the corresponding file name in the .py file.  
(5) Three fold 
 	3 folds is in data/list/3folds
(6) In order get the result on a trained model
	First make a LMDB file from image
	Then python context_network/trained_model/test.py
	At last python refinement_network/trained_model/test.py, you will get the estimation result
